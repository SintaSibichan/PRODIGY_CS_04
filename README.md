A keylogger is a type of surveillance software or hardware designed to record every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. This tool captures and logs keystrokes, which can include passwords, usernames, personal messages, and other sensitive information. Keyloggers are often used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft, spying, or unauthorized data collection. However, they can also be used for legitimate purposes, like monitoring employee activity or parental control. Due to their potential for abuse, keyloggers are closely scrutinized and regulated.
